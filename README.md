Here lists the description of each file in the repository

1_1_pflow_lasso_LOOCV.R: This is for the predictive modelling of treatment response of the drug umbralisib, using Lasso algorithm and (phospho) proteomics data. A nested leave-one-out cross-validation was constructed to evaluate the performance.

1_2_pflow_validation.R: This is for testing the selected proteins in 1_1 on an independent test set. Given that the test set only contains one class, Wilconxon's test were used to examine the predictions.

2_1_clustering.R: This is an unsupervised clustering within the non-responders using the k-means algorithm and DSS data, in order to explore potential treatment options for those who are likely not to respond to umbralisib.

2_2_correlation_plot.R: This is for exploring the correlation between (phospho) proteins and the selected drug combinations in 2_1.

my_function.r: Personal function for build the coding environment, such as loading required packages.

original_yogi_functions.r: This is the original codes from the package "yogiroc": https://github.com/jweile/yogiroc. Given that I need to edit it for better illustrations, the original codes were copied and sourced here.
